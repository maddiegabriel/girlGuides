## Some Ideas...

### Mad Libs generator sort of like these, we could add more options to make this work for the large group:

### "Guess the number" game

### some kind of branching story game where the girls can pick the storyline
maybe we could split into 2 groups to come up with each a different story, then each group gets the play their story on the projector for everyone?
or we could do one game all together on the projector!
